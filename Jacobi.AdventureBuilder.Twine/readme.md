# Twine Import

This utitlity transforms the adventure world definition from and to Twine.

Twine (download desktop app): https://twinery.org/

> Twine needs to have a plugin installed that allows the Twine definition to be represented as JSON.

The plugin: https://jtschoonhoven.github.io/twine-to-json/dist/harlowe-3.js
How to install the plugin: https://github.com/jtschoonhoven/twine-to-json

It is this JSON output generated by the Twine plugin that we use as an import.
