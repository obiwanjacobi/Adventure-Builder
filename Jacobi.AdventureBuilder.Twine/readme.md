# Twine Import

This utitlity transforms the adventure world definition from and to Twine.

Twine (download desktop app): https://twinery.org/

> Twine needs to have a plugin installed that allows the Twine definition to be represented as JSON.

The plugin: https://jtschoonhoven.github.io/twine-to-json/dist/harlowe-3.js

How to install the plugin: https://github.com/jtschoonhoven/twine-to-json

It is this JSON output generated by the Twine plugin that we use as an import.

## Twine Authoring

> Make sure you set the Story Format to `Harlow 3 to JSON x.x.x`. Navigate to the Story->Details to change it. If you already have some passages created, you need to change each one separately.

For each Passage enter a description (text) to set the mood of the place.

At the bottom, add the navigation options that are accessable from this Passage.

### Navigation

There are a couple of ways you can define a link from the current Passage to another passage.

| Link Syntax | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `[[Passage Target]]` | This will navigate to a Passage called `Passage Target` and that will also be displayed in the game. No extra link description is available here. |
| `[[Go to Passage Target->Passage Target]]` | This will navigate to a Passage called `Passage Target` but "Go to Passage Target" will be displayed in the game. No extra link description is available here. |
| `|Passage Target>[This is the desciption of Passage Target]` | This will add a description to a navigation link (one of the above). Place this close to the link it is connected to (`Passage Target`). |

### Generating JSON

With the Story open, navigate to the `Build` menu and select `Test` or `Play`. The JSON is now opened in the default browser and can be copied to a file. Make sure you copy everything in order not to save a corrupt file.

## Twine Import

The `Jacobi.AdventureBuilder.Twine` application takes a Twine JSON file and converts it to the format the game uses and stores it in the AdventureBuilder store.

### Commandline

To import a Twine JSON file use:

`Jacobi.AdventureBuilder.Twine --file "file path\with spaces.json"`

> Use double quotes around the file path if it contains spaces.

| Option | Description |
| -- | -- |
| -- file, -f | Loads the json file to be imported into the Adventure Builder.

### Configuration

It uses the REST API to perform this action and that requires a bit of configuration. Open the `appsettings.json` file to point to the base url of the REST API Service.

```json
{
  "ApiServiceUrl":  "https://localhost:7395"
}
```
